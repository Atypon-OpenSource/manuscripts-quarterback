/**
 * So these shenanigans are due to manuscripts-transform using window and other
 * browser-specific globals without any polyfills. Hence we need to declare them
 * before loading the module. ESM module resolution normally starts bottom-up
 * (meaning the entry point will always be evaluated last) so any attempts to declare
 * globals there will fail.
 *
 * Using dynamic imports we can prevent that and set the globals without having
 * to worry how the subsequent imports order up. Everything here will always be
 * evaluated first.
