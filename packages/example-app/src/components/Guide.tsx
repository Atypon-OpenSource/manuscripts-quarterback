        <p>
          This editor implements track changes and Yjs-based collaboration. All changes to the
          document are persisted to Redis instance and they should, once it's implemented, be saved
          as a regular ProseMirror or Manuscript JSON to Postgres after a certain cache duration has
          passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking changes happen by intercepting transactions and adding marks to text or
          attributes to nodes which contain the change data which currently are categorized as
          inserts/deletes/updates. This encompasses changes caused by{' '}
          <a
            href="https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#transform.ReplaceStep"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            ReplaceSteps
          </a>{' '}
          but not ReplaceAroundSteps as they need additional work to implement. Formatting changes
          are not tracked at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracking simple changes as such works but becomes convoluted when context-dependent
          changes are applied. For example inserting a table contains multiple nodes that are
          created in the same transaction but which all depend on the <code>table_element</code>{' '}
          being accepted. If it's rejected, all the changes within the <code>table_element</code>{' '}
          should be as well deleted. In some cases, however, such as deleting paragraphs the
          contents should be merged into the previous node which increases already very complicated
          work flow even further.
